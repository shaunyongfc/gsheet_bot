# gsheet_bot
Personal project linking a Google sheet with a Discord bot, with the following objectives:
- Learning to handling google sheet and data processing via Python into useful formats.
- Learning to observe community needs and to modify / innovate to be useful to the community.
- Improvement to Python coding skills in general.

Initially an experimental project for existing data of the following games:
- Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent (COTC): hiatus due to low need
- Final Fantasy Brave Exvius: War of the Visions (WOTV): constantly updated and successfully deployed to several WOTV game communities under a bot named Ildyra.

Apart from direct functions associated with Discord bot, there are auxiliary functions such as:
- Image/Animation processing for bot decorations (wotv_gif, wotv_png_process).
- WOTV player planning support functions (wotv_personal, wotv_personal2).
