# gsheet_bot
Personal project linking a Google sheet with a Discord bot, with the following objectives:
- Learning to handling google sheet and data processing via Python into useful formats.
- Learning to observe community needs and to modify / innovate to be useful to the community.
- Improvement to Python coding skills in general.

Initially an experimental project for existing data of the following games:
- Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent (COTC)
- Final Fantasy Brave Exvius: War of the Visions (WOTV)

Current status:
- COTC: hiatus due to lack of legitimate means to acquire data.
- WOTV: constantly updated and successfully deployed to several WOTV game communities under a bot named Ildyra.
